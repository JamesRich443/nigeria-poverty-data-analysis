# nigeria-poverty-data-analysis
This Python project aims to predict the poverty rate for using historical data from a sql dataset over the next five years using linear regression. The project utilizes historical data on poverty rates in Nigeria to train a linear regression model and forecast future poverty rates.
The script will connect to the SQL database, retrieve the historical poverty rate data, preprocess it, train the linear regression model, and predict the poverty rate for the next five years.
The predicted poverty rates will be displayed on the console and saved to a CSV file in the project directory.
Once the model is trained, the script uses it to predict the poverty rate for the next five years. The predicted poverty rates are displayed on the console along with coefficent of determination
